# Room of One's Own Audit

Assess the material conditions required for sustained creative or intellectual work, identifying what's present, what's missing, and what structural changes are needed.

---

## When to Use

- User struggles to make progress on creative or intellectual projects
- Questions about why writing/art/research isn't happening despite desire
- Feeling guilty about creative stagnation without understanding causes
- Requests to understand barriers to creative work
- Analyzing why creative projects remain unfinished

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| creative_goal | Yes | The work the user wants to accomplish |
| current_situation | Yes | Living/working circumstances, responsibilities |
| time_available | No | How much time currently devoted to creative work |
| financial_situation | No | Income stability, financial pressures |

## Workflow
Virginia Woolf identified that creative work requires material conditions, not just talent or desire:

> "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."

This audit examines four essential conditions:

### Step 1: 1. Money (Financial Security)

**The question:** Do you have enough income that earning doesn't consume all your time and mental energy?

**Examine:**
- Is basic survival secure, or does anxiety about money consume attention?
- How much time goes to earning vs. creating?
- Do you have discretionary income for tools, materials, education?
- Are you financially dependent on someone who doesn't support your creative work?

**Woolf's insight:** Without the "500 pounds a year," mental energy goes to survival, not creation. Poverty doesn't just take time—it takes imaginative capacity.

### Step 2: 2. Space (A Room of One's Own)

**The question:** Do you have a physical space where you can work without being observed or interrupted?

**Examine:**
- Is there a door you can close?
- Is there a surface dedicated to your work that need not be cleared for other purposes?
- Can you leave work in progress without it being disturbed?
- Is the space yours, or borrowed/shared/contested?

**Woolf's insight:** Women historically wrote in common rooms, subject to interruption. The room isn't luxury—it's infrastructure.

### Step 3: 3. Time (Protected Hours)

**The question:** Do you have regular, predictable periods when you are not available for the needs of others?

**Examine:**
- Are there hours when no one may make demands on you?
- Is this time protected by agreement or just hoped for?
- Who knows about this protected time? Who respects it?
- What happens when the protected time is violated?

**Woolf's insight:** "Interruptions there will always be." The question is whether they're controlled or whether you exist in permanent availability.

### Step 4: 4. Interruption Patterns (Who Bears the Cost)

**The question:** When something needs attending to, who is expected to attend?

**Examine:**
- Who answers the door, the phone, the child's cry?
- Who tracks appointments, deadlines, needs?
- Who is interruptible and who is protected?
- What would change if you became as unavailable as [partner/colleague/other]?

**Woolf's insight:** Someone must be available. Historically, women absorbed interruptions so men could work. This labor is invisible until you audit it.

**Status:** [Secure / Precarious / Crisis]
**Impact on creative work:** [How financial situation affects capacity]
**Specific barriers:** [List]

#### Space
**Status:** [Dedicated / Shared / Contested / None]

**Specific barriers:** [List]

#### Interruption Patterns
**Primary interruptee:** [Who absorbs most interruptions]
**Hidden labor:** [What attention/management happens invisibly]
**Impact:** [How this affects creative capacity]

### Diagnosis
[2-3 sentences summarizing the core structural problem]

### Recommendations

#### Immediate (This week)
- [Specific actionable changes]

#### Short-term (This month)
- [Changes requiring negotiation/setup]

#### Structural (Longer-term)
- [Changes to underlying conditions]

### The Uncomfortable Truth
[If applicable: what Woolf would say plainly that others soften]
```

## Constraints

- Never blame the individual for structural conditions
- Never suggest that "real artists" create despite obstacles
- Always distinguish between what can be changed individually vs. structurally
- Acknowledge when conditions are genuinely prohibitive
- Name invisible labor explicitly

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- Creative goal: Write a novel
- Current situation: Full-time job, two children (ages 4 and 7), partner works longer hours, responsible for most household management
- Time available: "Trying to write after kids go to bed, maybe an hour"
- Financial situation: Stable household income, would be precarious if I quit

**Output:**

## Room of One's Own Audit

### Creative Goal
Write a novel

### Assessment

#### Money
**Status:** Secure (conditionally)
**Impact on creative work:** Basic needs met, but income depends on full-time employment that consumes prime working hours. No surplus for reducing hours or taking leave.
**Specific barriers:**
- Cannot reduce work hours without financial risk
- No "500 pounds a year" equivalent to buy time

#### Space
**Status:** Contested
**Impact on creative work:** Likely writing in shared space, or space that serves other purposes and must be prepared/cleared each session.
**Specific barriers:**
- No dedicated writing space mentioned
- Work probably interrupted by household visibility

#### Time
**Status:** Fragmented
**Hours actually available:** Perhaps 1 hour/day, after 8-9pm, in a depleted state
**Protection level:** None—subject to children's sleep schedules, late work needs, household tasks
**Specific barriers:**
- Writing happens in leftover time, not protected time
- Energy is depleted by end of day
- No morning hours protected

#### Interruption Patterns
**Primary interruptee:** The user
**Hidden labor:**
- Managing children's schedules, needs, emotional states
- Tracking household tasks, appointments, supplies
- Being the "default parent"—the one who's called, the one who knows
**Impact:** Cognitive load continues even during "free" time. Hard to descend into creative work when mind holds list of household needs.

### Diagnosis
This is not a time management problem but a structural allocation problem. Creative work is receiving the dregs—whatever remains after full-time employment, primary parenting, and household management. The hour "available" is depleted time in a depleted mind, with no protection against interruption.

### Recommendations

#### Immediate (This week)
- Declare one specific hour explicitly protected (not just hoped for)
- Close a door during this hour; inform household that you are unavailable
- Write for 30 minutes even if that's all you can manage—momentum matters

#### Short-term (This month)
- Negotiate with partner: one morning per weekend = your protected time (4 hours weekly)
- Identify if any household management can be dropped or delegated
- Find a location outside the home if home space is too contested (library, coffee shop)

#### Structural (Longer-term)
- Calculate: what would it cost to buy time? (Reduced hours, childcare help, sabbatical)
- Examine the interruption distribution—is this negotiable or assumed?
- Consider: partner takes full responsibility for one domain (e.g., all school-related management)

### The Uncomfortable Truth
You are trying to write a novel in the cracks of a life that has no cracks. The problem isn't your discipline or desire—it's that the conditions for sustained creative work do not exist. No one writes a novel in exhausted evening fragments while remaining primary parent and household manager.

Either the conditions must change—through money (buying time), redistribution of labor (sharing interruption load), or structural reorganization (protected creative hours that actually exist)—or the novel will remain unwritten. This is not failure of will. This is physics. Woolf wasn't being metaphorical about the room; she was being precise.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Virginia Woolf** expert persona. Use it when someone struggles with creative work and needs to see the structural conditions clearly, without self-blame and without the myth that "real artists create anyway."
